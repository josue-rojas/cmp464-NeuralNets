>The special thing about humans is their ability to gather and share information to better improve.... or something like that

The point of this repo is to succeed in truly understanding what we learn by our greatest resource which is each other (and our collection of information). 

### Rules
- Make a folder with your name which will have your notes or stuff or anything relevant to the class
- try to not directly push directly to the master branch
  - instead make a new branch and do a pull request (this is just to avoid any mess or accidental stuff)

- idk..... i'll add more later when i think of them
